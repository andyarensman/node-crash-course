# Node Crash Course

Worked through the tutorial series on Node.js by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU).

Very detailed and well thought out - would highly recommend. I used it to help with my [Hiker Tracker](https://github.com/andyarensman/Hiker-Tracker).
